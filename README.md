# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In this I've carefully followed every instruction and requirement of the project 0. I've created two SCSS files and one CSS file for following requirements. 
In CSS file 'paragraphstyling' I've used different CSS styling, id and media query this file is linked to all four html pages.
In SCSS file 'firstnesting' I've used nesting which is linked to first html page 'index.html'.
In SCSS file 'secondnesting' I've used variable and inheritance which is linked to second html page 'second.html' and fourth html page 'fourth.html'.
In first page I've placed a write up about me then in second I've talked about my interest using ordered and unordered list along with a table. In third page I've placed and image and talked further about it and in last fourth page I've used grid and columns.
Each html page is linked by eachother.
